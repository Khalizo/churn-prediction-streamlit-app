# Capstone Project Proposal 
This project proposal outlines the key steps that would be needed for completing the churn the prediction project. 
The seven key points are:
* The project's **domain background** — the field of research where the project is derived;
* A **problem statement** — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
* The **datasets and inputs** — data or inputs being used for the problem;
* A **solution statement** — the solution proposed for the problem given;
* A **benchmark model** — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
* A set of **evaluation metrics** — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
* An outline of the **project design** — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.
